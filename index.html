            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Erick, I also go by Kairos; either one is fine. I'm currently a 
                junior at Lewis and my major is computer science + music. Outside of school,
                I am highly dedicated to music and have been very fortunate to be involved in
                several different bands and ensembles. I mostly play guitar and have been
                playing for almost six years now. I enjoy recording, producing, mixing and 
                mastering as well as performing for audiences of varying sizes. I've
                lived my whole life in Joliet, Illinois with my family and have tried my best
                to be an active member in my city's community. I am also proud to call myself a
                Gates and Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar. I'm excited to take this software
                engineering course, finally getting some more hands-on experience and a chance to 
                work on a programming project to add to my resume.

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>I performed at a halftime show for the Ohio State @ Illinois game back in October. It was my first major
                sports event and it was completely sold out. Unfortunately, Illinois lost pretty badly. Still had a great time. Here's a picture.</p>
